## About

The Accessibility Insights Azure DevOps (ADO) extension and GitHub action help integrate automated accessibility tests in your Azure pipeline and GitHub workflow. You can configure the ADO extension and GitHub action to scan a single page or crawl an entire site. This can work for static HTML files in your repository, a local web server, or remote URLs.

The ADO extension and GitHub action use the [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) rules engine to scan websites and web apps for common accessibility issues.

While automated checks can detect some common accessibility problems such as missing or invalid properties, most accessibility problems can only be discovered through manual testing. The best way to evaluate web accessibility compliance is to complete an assessment using [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview/).
