Accessibility Insights Action helps integrate automated accessibility tests in GitHub workflow.

**This is a pre-release version and therefore not production ready yet.**

**This repo does not assume any responsibility for supporting issues that might be caused due to its use at this point in time.**

## Usage

To use this action in your workflow (which, again, we don't yet recommend at all for any production projects), we recommend referring to a version tag:

-   `microsoft/accessibility-insights-action@v1` is updated with each `v1.x.y` release to refer to the most recent API-compatible version.
-   `microsoft/accessibility-insights-action@v1.0.0` refers to the exact version `v1.0.0`; use this to pin to a specific version.

Avoid refering to `@main` directly; it may contain undocumented breaking changes.
