## Release instructions

To create a new release, a repo maintainer should follow these steps:

1. Create and merge a release pull request to `main` which:
    - Updates `/package.json` with a new semantic version number
    - Updates `/docs/usage.md` if needed to reference the upcoming tag
    - Updates `/NOTICES.txt` based on the dependencies in `yarn.lock`
    - Updates `/dist/` with the results of `yarn build`
2. Validate the release build
    - Wait for a passing CI build against `main`
    - Update a separate test repository to refer to `accessibility-insights-action@mergecommithash` and verify that it functions as expected
3. Create/update the corresponding git tags for the release:
    - Create a new release tag using the version in `package.json` (eg, `git tag v1.2.3`)
    - Update the corresponding major-version tag (eg, `git tag -f v1`)
    - Push both tags
