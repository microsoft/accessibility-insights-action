# Accessibility Insights for Azure DevOps

Accessibility Insights for Azure DevOps is an extension that enables you to integrate Accessibility Insights' automated checks, powered by [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), into your Azure pipeline.

While automated checks can detect some common accessibility problems such as missing or invalid properties, most accessibility problems can only be discovered through manual testing. The best way to evaluate web accessibility compliance is to complete an assessment using [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview/).

## Features

-   Scan all the pages in your website using the crawler, or define a list of URLs to scan

-   Get a combined and deduplicated report of all issues found in the scan

-   Get a summary of results both in the task log and the Extensions tab of the Azure Pipelines UI

-   (Optional) Block pull requests if there are accessibility issues found

## Documentation

For more details about the extension visit [Accessibility Insights for Azure DevOps on Engineering Hub](https://eng.ms/docs/cloud-ai-platform/devdiv/one-engineering-system-1es/1es-docs/accessibility-insights/accessibility-insights-for-azure-devops).
