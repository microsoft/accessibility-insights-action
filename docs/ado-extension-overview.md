# Accessibility Insights Extension

_This extension is in beta and preview mode._

The Accessibility Insights for Azure DevOps extension enables you to integrate Accessibility automated checks, powered by [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), into your Azure pipeline.

## Features

-   Define a list of URLs or use the crawler to scan all the pages in your website

-   Get a combined and deduplicated report of all issues found in the scan

-   Add a comment to your PR with the results summary on repos hosted on Azure DevOps

-   (Optional) block PRs if there are accessibility issues found

## Documentation & Feedback

For more details about the extension or to provide feedback, please [visit our GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-action)

_Automated checks can detect some common accessibility problems such as missing or invalid properties. But most accessibility problems can only be discovered through manual testing. Evaluate your web accessibility compliance completing an assessment with [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview/)._
