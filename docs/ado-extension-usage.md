# How to use the Azure DevOps extension

These instructions are for version 2 of the extension.

-   To migrate from version 1, see [Migrating from version 1 to version 2](#migrating-from-version-1-to-version-2)
-   For version 1 docs, see [the version of this document as of the v1.1.1 release](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-action/blob/v1.1.1-sources-ado/docs/ado-extension-usage.md)

## Prerequisites

### Tools

-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) >= 1.22.10
    -   The Accessibility Insights for Azure DevOps extension uses Yarn to install dependencies. If your build agent does not come with Yarn pre-installed, you must add a step to install it yourself.
    ```yml
    - script: npm install yarn@1.22.10 -g
      displayName: install yarn as a global dependency
    ```
-   You must have either a static HTML file to point the Accessibility Insights task to, or be able to serve your website at a localhost URL in an Azure DevOps pipeline.
    -   If your site's build/bundling process produces an HTML file that you can open directly, you can point the extension directly at the built HTML file using the `staticSiteDir` input.
    -   If your site needs to be run using a specific server (eg, an Express server with specific routes configured), you should include any relevant steps to set up a localhost instance of your app prior to running the Accessibility Insights task. You can then point the Accessibility Insights task to the localhost URL that is serving your site using the `url` input.

## Adding the extension

Install [Accessibility Insights for Azure DevOps - Production](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=accessibility-insights.prod).

-   See [Install extensions from Azure DevOps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/marketplace/install-extension?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser) for steps on how to install an extension to your organization.

Reference this extension in your Azure pipelines by adding the relevant YAML file using the snippets on this document as guidance.

-   See [task.json](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-action/blob/main/packages/ado-extension/task.json) for option descriptions.

Note: we also support adding the task via the classic pipeline interface in Azure DevOps.

### Basic template

Save this workflow file in your Azure DevOps repo as `azure-pipelines.yml` or in your GitHub repo as `/pipelines/accessibility-validation.yml`.

When you push this file to your repository, you should see the task running in the build.

```yml
trigger:
    - main

pool:
    vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
    # Insert any jobs here required to build your website files

    - task: accessibility-insights.prod.task.accessibility-insights@3
      displayName: Scan for accessibility issues
      inputs:
          # Provide either staticSiteDir or url
          # staticSiteDir: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/path-to-built-website/'
          # url: 'your-website-url'
```

### Scan a URL

Provide the website URL. The URL should already be hosted - something like `http://localhost:12345/` or `https://example.com`.

```yml
- task: accessibility-insights.prod.task.accessibility-insights@3
  displayName: Scan for accessibility issues
  inputs:
      url: 'http://localhost:12345/'
```

The `url` parameter takes priority over `staticSiteDir`. If `url` is provided, static file options like `staticSiteDir` and `staticSiteUrlRelativePath` are ignored.

### Scan local HTML files

Provide the location of your built HTML files using `staticSiteDir` and (optionally) `staticSiteUrlRelativePath`. The action will serve the site for you using `express`.

```yml
- task: accessibility-insights.prod.task.accessibility-insights@3
  displayName: Scan for accessibility issues
  inputs:
      staticSiteDir: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/website/root/'
      staticSiteUrlRelativePath: '/'
```

The file server will host files inside `staticSiteDir`. The action begins crawling from `http://localhost:port/staticSiteUrlRelativePath/`.

If you prefer to start crawling from a child directory, note that:

-   the local file server can only host descendants of `staticSiteDir`
-   By default, the crawler only visits links prefixed with `http://localhost:port/staticSiteUrlRelativePath/`. If you want to crawl links outside `staticSiteUrlRelativePath`, provide something like `discoveryPatterns: 'http://localhost:port/[.*]'`

### Modify crawling options

The action supports several crawling options defined in [task.json](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-action/blob/main/packages/ado-extension/task.json).

For instance, you can:

-   use `maxUrls: 1` to exclusively set the extension to only scan the first Url that has been inputted
-   set `maxUrls` to the number of URLs in `inputUrls` to scan a fixed list of URLs for your site

For `discoveryPatterns`, `inputFile`, and `inputUrls`, note that these options expect resolved URLs. If you provide static HTML files via `staticSiteDir`, you should also provide `staticSitePort` so that you can anticipate the base URL of the file server (`http://localhost:staticSitePort/`).

Examples:

```yml
- task: accessibility-insights.prod.task.accessibility-insights@2
  displayName: Scan for accessibility issues (with url)
  inputs:
      url: 'http://localhost:12345/'
      inputUrls: 'http://localhost:12345/other-url http://localhost:12345/other-url2'
```

```yml
- task: accessibility-insights.prod.task.accessibility-insights@2
  displayName: Scan for accessibility issues (with staticSiteDir)
  inputs:
      staticSiteDir: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/website/root/'
      staticSitePort: '12345'
      inputUrls: 'http://localhost:12345/unlinked-page.html'
```

## Using a baseline file

Baseline files are intended to make it easy to detect accessibility changes introduced by a PR. A baseline file exists in the repo and represents the last known accessibility scan results. During each PR, the scanner runs on the PR output and compares the results to the baseline file. Any difference represents changes that are caused by the PR in question. The PR author then chooses between changing the code (if the change was unintended) or updating the baseline file (if the change was intended). The workflow is as follows:

1. The accessibility scanner runs on each PR iteration.
2. If the scanner results match the baseline file, the scanner task succeeds. There is no need to modify the baseline file for these PR's.
3. If the scanner results do not match the baseline file, the scanner task fails and creates an updated baseline file. If the author chooses to update the baseline file, they download the updated baseline file from the build artifacts, incorporate it into the PR, and push a new commit. This triggers a new PR iteration where the baseline file should now be current.

For a commit that initially specifies a baseline file, the scanner will fail in step 2. Download the updated baseline file, incorporate it into the PR, and push the result.

### Baseline files

Each baseline file is a text-based file hosted in your repo. It tracks known accessibility violations. If your pipeline runs PR's in multiple environments (different browsers and/or operating systems), you should use a separate baseline file for each environment. This allows for a clear signal of how each environment is impacted by any specific change. Even though the baseline file is textual, merging of this file is strongly discouraged. In the case where the baseline file has been modified by competing commits, the safest option is to merge changes from **main** and simply accept the current **main** version of the baseline file, then push that change to the PR. This will trigger a new scan and ensure that any accessibility scan results that are reported are limited to those related to the current PR.

The baseline file is specified as a parameter to the scanning task, as shown in the YAML below.

### Publishing baseline files

When the scanning tool fails, it creates a new baseline file--reflecting the current accessibility scanner results--on the disk of the build machine. This file has the same filename as the input baseline file. You must configure your pipeline to publish the updated baseline file as an artifact so that the PR author can easily access the updated baseline file. The recommended practice is to publish the entire scanner's output folder on every iteration, _including iterations where the accessibility scanner task failed_. This will provide the combined accessibility scan results on _every_ build, as well as the modified baseline file when changes are required.

### Example YAML

Here is an example of a YAML file that is configured to take advantage of a baseline, assuming just one environment:

```yml
- task: accessibility-insights.prod.task.accessibility-insights@3
  displayName: Scan for accessibility issues
  inputs:
      url: 'http://localhost:12345/'
      baselineFile: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/baselines/my-web-site.baseline'
```

## Report Artifacts

By default, an HTML report containing detailed results is automatically uploaded as a pipeline artifact named `accessibility-reports`. You can customize this artifact name by setting the `outputArtifactName` parameter in your YAML file. A link to the artifact will appear in both the task log and in the Extensions tab of the pipeline run.

To view the report, navigate to Artifacts from the build. Under `accessibility-reports`, or the artifact name manually specified, you'll find the downloadable report labeled `index.html`.

If you would prefer not to upload an artifact, or if you are in a Pipelines environment where individual tasks are not allowed to upload artifacts (for example, OneBranch), you can opt out of this automatic artifact upload by setting the `uploadOutputArtifact` parameter to `false`. You can set the `outputDir` parameter to control where the output gets written to on the build agent.

## Summary results

-   Summary results are output in both the task log and in the Extensions tab of the pipeline run. To view the task log, click into the job and then click on the `accessibilityinsights` task.

## Blocking pull requests

You can choose to block pull requests if the extension finds accessibility issues.

1. Ensure the extension is [triggered on each pull request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/customize-pipeline?view=azure-devops#customize-ci-triggers).
2. Ensure that you have set the `failOnAccessibilityError` input variable to `true`.

## Running multiple times in a single pipeline

If you want to run multiple Accessibility Insights steps in a single pipeline, you will need to ensure that each step uses a unique `outputArtifactName`.

Each step also needs a unique output directory on the build agent. The task will generate unique output directories for you by default, but if you override `outputDir`, you will need to ensure that it is also unique among all steps.

## Migrating from version 1 to version 2

Version 2.x of the extension contains several breaking changes from version 1.x. To migrate, you will need to make a few adjustments based on whether your pipeline is defined using a YAML file or the "Classic" Pipelines web interface:

### Migrating a YAML Pipeline definition

1. The Accessibility Insights task no longer requires extra Azure DevOps permissions to work
    - If you previously specified a `repoServiceConnectionName` input, you should remove it. If this Service Connection was created solely for use with this pipeline, you should delete it in your Azure DevOps Project's "Service Connections" settings.
    - If you did not previously specify `repoServiceConnectionName`, it likely means that the default Azure DevOps Build Service account for your Azure DevOps project has been granted the `repo:write` permission for this repository. You should audit for this and remove that permission if it is not required by other tasks.
2. The task inputs related to specifying a "static" site to scan (`siteDir`, `localhostPort`, and `scanUrlRelativePath`) have changed to make it more clear that they are related (and mutually exclusive with `url`).
    - If you previously specified a `siteDir`, you should:
        - Rename your existing `siteDir` input to `staticSiteDir`
        - Rename your existing `localhostPort` input to `staticSitePort` (if specified)
        - Rename your existing `scanUrlRelativePath` input to `staticSiteUrlRelativePath` (if specified)
    - If you previously specified _both_ `url` and `siteDir`, you had a misconfiguration - these inputs were mutually exclusive, and the `url` input was being silently ignored. Remove the `url` input and follow the instructions above for `siteDir`.
    - If you previously specified just `url` and not `siteDir`, you should leave the original `url` input as-is
3. Publishing a pipeline artifact containing scan results is now built into the Accessibility Insights task, instead of being a separate step you must add yourself afterwards
    - If you previously used a separate `publish` step to upload the `_accessibility-reports` folder, you can delete that `publish` step
    - If your pipeline is running in OneBranch, or any other environment where individual tasks cannot publish artifacts directly, specify `uploadOutputArtifact: false` to skip the new automatic artifact uploading. You can specify `outputDir` to control where the output artifact contents get written to on the build agent
    - See [Report Artifacts](#report-artifacts) for more details, including how to customize the artifact name
4. By default, the task now fails if it detects an accessibility failure (unless the failure is a known issue tracked by a [Baseline File](#using-a-baseline-file))
    - If you previously specified `failOnAccessibilityError: true`, you can remove it (this is now the default behavior)
    - If you would prefer to keep the old behavior, where accessibility issues are not treated as a task failure, you can add `failOnAccessibilityError: false` (but consider [using a Baseline File](#using-a-baseline-file) instead!)

### Migrating a "Classic" Pipeline definition

1. The Accessibility Insights task no longer requires extra Azure DevOps permissions to work
    - There is no longer an option for "Azure Repos Connection". If you previously specified a Service Connection using this option, and that Service Connection was created solely for use with this pipeline, you should delete it in your Azure DevOps Project's "Service Connections" settings.
    - If you did not previously specify an "Azure Repos Connection", it likely means that the default Azure DevOps Build Service account for your Azure DevOps project has been granted the `repo:write` permission for this repository. You should audit for this and remove that permission if it is not required by other tasks.
2. The options related to specifying which site to scan have moved underneath a new "Hosting Mode" option to make it more clear which ones can be used together.
    - If you previously specified a "Site Directory", select the "Static Site" Hosting Mode
        - The "Static Site Directory", "Static Site Port" and "Static Site URL Relative Path" task inputs now appear only when "Static Site" is selected
    - If you previously specified a "Website URL", select the "Dynamic Site" "Hosting Mode"
        - The "Dynamic Site URL" option now appears only when "Dynamic Site" is selected
    - If you previously specified _both_ as "Site Directory" and a "Website URL", you had a misconfiguration - these options were mutually exclusive, and the "Website URL" option was being silently ignored. Select "Static Site" Hosting Mode and ignore your old "Website URL" input
3. Publishing a pipeline artifact containing scan results is now built into the Accessibility Insights task, instead of being a separate step you must add yourself afterwards
    - If you previously used a separate "Publish" step to upload the `_accessibility-reports` folder, you can delete that "Publish" step
    - If your pipeline is running in OneBranch, or any other environment where individual tasks cannot publish artifacts directly, uncheck the "Upload Output Artifact" option to skip the new automatic artifact uploading. You can specify an "Output Directory" to control where the output artifact contents get written to on the build agent
    - See [Report Artifacts](#report-artifacts) for more details, including how to customize the artifact name
4. The "Fail on Accessibility Error" option is now checked by default; when it is checked, the task will fail if it detects an accessibility failure (unless the failure is a known issue tracked by a [Baseline File](#using-a-baseline-file))
    - If you would prefer to keep the old behavior, where accessibility issues are not treated as a task failure, you can still uncheck this option (but consider [using a Baseline File](#using-a-baseline-file) instead!)
5. The "Chrome Path" option has moved under a new "Advanced Options" group

## Troubleshooting

-   If the action didn't trigger as you expected, check the `trigger` or `pr` sections of your yml file. Make sure any listed branch names are correct for your repository.
-   If the action fails to complete, you can check the build logs for execution errors. Using the template above, these logs will be in the `Scan for accessibility issues` step.
-   If the scan takes longer than 90 seconds, you can override the default timeout by providing a value for `scanTimeout` in milliseconds.
