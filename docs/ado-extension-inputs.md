# Accessibility Insights for Azure DevOps inputs

-   `url` (string) **Required**. The URL to scan and crawl for accessibility issues.

or

-   `staticSiteDir` (string) **Required**. Directory containing the HTML files to be scanned.

-   `staticSiteUrlRelativePath` (string). Default: `/`. Set the base URL when the site lives at a subpath of the domain, such as `/blog`. If unspecified, the site will be scanned at the root.

-   `staticSitePort` (int). The preferred local website TCP port to use when serving local website content. If unspecified, a port will be set automatically. If the pipeline serves additional processes, set the port to avoid conflicts. If using baselining, set the port to make sure future scans will match the baseline file.

## Additional inputs

-   `authType` (One of: "AAD"). For sites with authenticated pages, use with `serviceAccountName` and `serviceAccountPassword` to specify the authentication type. Learn [how to set up authentication](https://aka.ms/AI-action-auth).

-   `serviceAccountName` (string). Email address for the service account to be used in authentication. Use the Key Vault task to securely set the email address. Learn [how to set up authentication with Key Vault](https://aka.ms/AI-action-auth).

-   `serviceAccountPassword` (string). Password for the service account to be used in authentication. Use the Key Vault task to securely set the password. Learn [how to set up authentication with Key Vault](https://aka.ms/AI-action-auth).

-   `maxUrls` (int). Default: `100`. Maximum number of pages opened by crawler. The crawl will stop when this limit is reached.

-   `discoveryPatterns` (string). List of RegEx patterns to crawl in addition to the provided URL, separated by space.

-   `inputFile` (string). File path that contains list of URLs (each separated by a new line) to scan in addition to URLs discovered from crawling the provided URL.

-   `inputUrls` (string). List of URLs to crawl in addition to URLs discovered from crawling the provided URL, separated by space.

-   `scanTimeout` (int). Default: `90000`. The maximum timeout in milliseconds for the scan (excluding dependency setup).

-   `failOnAccessibilityError` (boolean). Default: `true`. Fail the task if there are accessibility issues.

-   `baselineFile` (string). The old baseline file path, a new baseline will be generated with the same name. If unspecified, the baseline option will be disabled.

-   `singleWorker` (boolean) **Required**. Default: `true`. To get deterministic scanning results, either specify the singleWorker parameter or ensure that the value specified for the maxUrls parameter is larger than the total number of urls in the web site being scanned.

-   `uploadOutputArtifact` (boolean) **Required**. Default: `true`. Automatically upload the result as an artifact to the build. Set to `false` if you need to upload the artifact manually in a separate task or publish step.

-   `outputArtifactName` (string). Default: `accessibility-reports`. Name of the report artifact to be uploaded to the build. Ignored if `uploadOutputArtifact` is `false`.

-   `outputDir` (string). Directory to write the scan output to. Its contents will be uploaded as a pipeline artifact unless `uploadOutputArtifact` is set to `false`. If unspecified, output will be written to a generated temporary directory.

-   `chromePath` (string). Path to Chrome executable. By default, the task downloads a version of Chrome that is tested to work with this task.
